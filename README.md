# Hello, World! I'm Rastin
## Bridging the Gap between Tech & Psyche 🧠

👨‍💻 My binary brain toggles between 1s, 0s, and the nuances of human psychology. 🧠

Through my ventures I'm debugging the challenges of mental well-being accessibility. Each repo and pull request is but a byte in my grand codebase of a mission:

🌍 To merge AI and psychopathology not just to patch severe mental health conditions, but to refactor the code that governs our emotional and psychological well-being. 🤖➕❤️
